# Step 1: Get list of all meds by looking at HTML (maybe start out as a set from the get go, or maybe convert to set at the very end)

# Step 2: Verify that no WHO EML medicines are missing from this list (i.e., there are no WHO EML medicines that are not also on at least one national EML)

# Notes:
# Wasn't able to scrape/crawl WHO website, so had to download HTML files individually.
# All the functions work but probably need to completely redesign since I'm doing a different thing.
# Then need a function to write to a CSV
# Laura's rethinking her strategy: since sets aren't ordered it'll be a little bit odd, so should make into list
# Suggested data structure: one big dict with 137 items, each item is key (country): value (big list of binaries which correspond to LIST). LIST is list of medicines which is converted to list from set.


# Laura only downloaded differences with WHO.


# Number of countries had to be manually determined by scrolling down to the last country on the list (currently Zimbabwe) 
# and finding its index from the end of the url (currently 137). Could not figure out how to automate this process, as the original url
# (https://global.essentialmeds.org/dashboard/countries/) does not have an html file that contains countries' indices past Bhutan and
# clicking on "Z" did not produce a unique url whose html file would containing all country indexes where the country name started with "Z". 
# Worth double-checking to see if NUM_COUNTRIES is still 137 each time this is refreshed.

# try this with True and if you get an empty dataframe, it's because the HMTL file thinks your browser is out of date.

# and name them "EML_i.html", where i = 1, ..., 137.
